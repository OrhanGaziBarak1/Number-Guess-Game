# Number Guess Game
 The number guessing game coded with C language and it was my homework.

The game creates a random number which is numbers' are different and which is greater than 10^4 and smaller than 10^10.

The player select number's digits amount, so game starts.

Then the player try to guess the number. The game returns to player about player's guesses.

The game is able to say the number's figures' places are true or wrong, player's moves amount and also sorted form all guesses.
